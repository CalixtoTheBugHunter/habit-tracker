# Execute Vibe Coding

When the user invokes **execute-vibe-coding** (or asks for vibe coding on a PoC), follow this protocol. This is an **experimentation-only** workflow: no code is ever pushed.

## 1. Input

- **Option A**: User shares PoC details directly in chat.
- **Option B**: User shares a GitHub issue. Use the GitHub MCP server to fetch the issue (e.g. `mcp_github_get_issue`) and use its title/body as the PoC spec.

If anything is unclear, ask one short round of questions, then proceed.

## 2. Branch and safety

- Create a **test branch** (e.g. `vibe-poc/<short-name>` or `test/<issue-number>-poc`) from the current default branch.
- **Never push.** No `git push`, no remote updates. All work stays local.

## 3. Execution (unsupervised)

You are **allowed to do everything unsupervised** in this mode:

- Edit any files, add dependencies, refactor as needed for the PoC.
- Run the test suite (e.g. `npm test`, `pytest`, etc.) and fix failures until tests pass.
- Run the app and use the **Browser MCP** to drive the UI and verify behavior:
  - Navigate, click, fill forms, assert visible state.
  - Repeat until the PoC behavior is confirmed working.
- Iterate: implement → run tests → run app → browser check → adjust until the PoC works.

## 4. Definition of done (for the agent)

- Tests relevant to the PoC are green.
- Browser-based checks show the PoC working as specified (by user or issue).
- You briefly report what was built and how to run/try it.

## 5. Handoff to user

- Summarize: what the PoC does, which branch it’s on, how to run tests and the app.
- **User decides**: experimentation is finished, or more details/iterations are needed. Do not push; do not merge unless the user explicitly asks outside this command.

## Quick reference

| Do | Don’t |
|----|--------|
| Create a test branch | Push to remote |
| Run tests and fix until green | Merge to main/default |
| Use Browser MCP to verify UI | Assume done without browser check |
| Iterate until PoC works | Stop while tests are red or PoC is broken |
| Work unsupervised | Ask for permission for each small step |
